# Reminders during Activities Device (RAD)

## Overview

The RAD (Reminders during Activities Device) uses a Freenove ESP32 GPIO Extension Board to assist patients with dementia during the day. People with dementia have a very difficult time with 
remembering tasks and schedules. By using this device, patients may reference instructions on how to complete daily tasks and previously written notes in a simplistic and accessible manner.

## Features

**Steps**: People with dementia will often be able to remember daily tasks such as getting a cup of coffee, but they may forget which step they're on while they're doing the activity. 
This device will alert the patient when it passes by an activity and will present a step-by-step feature, guiding them through the task.

**Notes**: Remembering new things is nearly impossible for someone with dementia, even in the early stages of the disease. The second feature to this device uses the LightBlue application to connect to the ESP32
via bluetooth. The patient can write their message in 15 letters per line for two lines on the LightBlue app and it will store that message for the patient to read at any time.
